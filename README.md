First implementation step for what I learnt from 3Blue1Brown's video series on neural nets and transformers.

Using Kaggle's MNIST dataset digit-recognizer as an example: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview

Code written entirely through ChatGPT with a goal to understand how neural nets are implemented practically.

Code for cnn copied from the winning entry here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/tirdadlajmouraki/cnn-pytorch-full-guide
Chat link to understand CNNs through this code: https://chatgpt.com/share/68934a6e-855c-800b-9ad9-fd9be3b8598e

Accuracy through biggernet: ~95.5%
Accuracy through hugenet: ~92%
Accuracy through CNN: 99.15%
